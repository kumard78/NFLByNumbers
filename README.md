# Domain chosen
We have decided to delve into the world of sports analytics, and we will be focused on the National Football League.
 
# Hypothesis or project topic
We will likely be trying to take the data and answer a variety of questions, but the main theme of our work will be trying to predict future performance for today’s players using historical data. 
 
# Available data sources
 
The data required for this project is pretty easily available online.  There are several sources that we will look to gather together to create a full picture of player performance.
 
* Armchairanalysis.com:  The bulk of our dataset will come from Armchair Analysis.  This is a pay service that has compiled 18 years of historical data for every game on a play by play basis.  Using our .edu email address, we will be able to purchase the historical data for $100.
* Pro-Football-Reference.com:  Pro Football Reference contains a wealth of historical data for free.  At the moment, we have identified it as a source for historical pro bowl rosters, but depending on the questions we would like to answer, we might pull in more data from this site.
* Sportrac.com:  Sportrac is a great resource for salary data, but unfortunately, it is more forward looking than backward looking.  If we decide to draw in some historical salary data, this website does have a cash earnings breakdown with some history for currently active players.
* Nextgenstats.nfl.com:  Next Gen Stats only has two years of history, but it has some very interesting visualizations on the site.  In particular, the website can show you the routes that both receivers and running backs took for any particular game as well as where quarterbacks threw their passes.  While the raw data does not look to be readily available, scraping the provided images into a database might provide some interesting insights.
 
# Approach/Questions
 
We plan to pull as much data as we can gather into our database, and then see if we can draw insights that will help predict a player’s future performance.  Given that every snap for the last 18 years has been meticulously recorded by Armchair Analysis we can use machine learning to look for patterns in how various players perform against particular defenders, home/away, etc.  We can then try to use those insights to predict a player’s future performance against a given team.  Since we are also drawing in Pro Bowl data, we can attempt to see which stats are most predictive when it comes to earning a Pro Bowl spot.  Finally, if we can pull in enough historical salary data, we can evaluate how earnings are affected by historical performance. 
 
It is likely that we will come up with additional questions to test as we work through the data.
